## 2D Plotting

This folder contains basic examples for plotting 2D graphs from postprocessed Trackit data.

## Usage

Copy preferencesExample.r to preferences.r (preferencesExample.r is under version control, is used by the programs but is not under version control).

Open one of the r files, plotXT.r, plotYT.r, plotZT.r, plotXY.r in RStudio(only plotCommon.r can not be executed alone)
Executed the code by clicking onto "Source with Echo" 

In the file dialog navigate to a postprocessed, splined file with file extension csv and open it.
After a short while you should find a plot in the Viewer tab of RStudio.

The file plotCommon.r is a little complex but the other files should be  straight forward. 
Feel free to modify according to your needs.
